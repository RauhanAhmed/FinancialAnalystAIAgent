## Important Update: Kimi AI Integration

To enhance performance and extend the context window while reducing latency, the AI model has been switched from **Google Gemini Flash 2.0** to **Moonshot AI's Kimi AI**. This change ensures better efficiency in processing large amounts of tool calls and data requests without any degradation in performance. Instead, processing speed has improved due to reduced computational overhead.  

Use **MOONSHOT_API_KEY** as the environment variable and obtain a key from [Moonshot AI's official API page](https://platform.moonshot.cn/docs/api/chat). Since the page is in Chinese, use a browser translation extension to view it in English.
